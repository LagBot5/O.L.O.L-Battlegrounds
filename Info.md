# Information

## Purpose
To use and learn classes by making a game. We will try to use classes where we can to simplify and reduce repetition. For example, when we create characters we would want to use classes to create new characters. Our purpose is to keep our code clean and easy to work with.

## Concept
The concept of our game is a turn based fighting game using students and teachers as characters. Every character will have four skills you can choose fromm, but you only will only use three. These skills will have their own effects and names, but some skills may be similar to eachother  Each character and skill will have its own element that will have strengths and weaknesses
to other elements. The background or environment will also have an effect on the characters based on their elements. It may effect them by increasing or decreasing one of their stats.
